# Faculty Classification

This chapter summarizes how non-tenure track faculty have been classified.  Most research appeals to work conducted by Gappa and Leslie (1993).  However, classification schemas are typically developed in a qualitative fashion and there has not been any emphasis to draw on quantitative methods and high dimensional data to see if better classification schemas may be possible.  I use k-means clustering to identify faculty groups and then crosstabulate those categories across a range of faculty characteristics.
