# Faculty Classification

This analysis, the second chapter of my dissertation, uses k-means clustering to classify non-tenure track faculty in the HERI faculty study.  Over 100 faculty features were used to group the faculty and their classes were crosstabulated across demographic, institutional, departmental and employment characteristics.
